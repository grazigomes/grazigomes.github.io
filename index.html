		<h3> About Me</h3>
        <p>I came to the United States from Brazil four years ago because I realized there was much more I wanted to experience. 
		It took great courage to leave an established career in a large corporation to try starting again and change my story. 
		Over the years of developing my professional skills, I found myself to be precise, focused, disciplined, and organized. 
		I had studied accounting and realized that it was not for me. I have always been a dreamer, 
		and giving up on my dreams was never an option. As I was always passionate about English, 
		coming specifically to the USA was very important. Finally, I took the opportunity to study in the United States. 
		This was possibly one of the best things I could ask for in my life. I found myself with a lack of opportunities in front of me, 
		and I could decide to do anything I like. When I read about Interactive Multimedia I instantly connected with it. 
		I would be able to build apps and websites, work with photos and videos which I’ve always loved among other possibilities. 
		Now I am about to graduate and I couldn’t be more proud of myself for the path I chose.</p>

  <!-- columns should be the immediate child of a .row -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode1.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/" target="_blank">GitHub Portfolio Home Page<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> is an introduction to GitHub to understand how to manage it. I learned more about GitHub by creating a repository and a branch; making a commit, opening a pull request, and merging a pull request. I also learned how to use GitHub to host web pages creating a home page for my web projects, and using markdown syntax to format and style my GitHub home page.</div>
	<div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode2.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/appliedaccessibility/" target="_blank">Applied Accessibility Design<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> is a practice for making a website accessible. First, I was given a webpage to improve using applied accessibility design. Then I had to use the links on this page to direct the user to the following pages: one link would show the page I was given without accessibility; the second link would be to show the revised webpage; the third link would show a page with all the improvements made, and the last one would link to my Portfolio Page. </div>    
  </div>
  <div class="row">
	<div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode3.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/mamonas/" target="_blank">HTML Tribute Page<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> is a review of the HTML5 semantic elements and basic CSS skills. I had to create a tribute web page following basic requirements such as creating a few “id” and “div”, using a link which leads to an outside site, and making the “img” element responsively resized and centered.</div>
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode4.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/appliedvisualdesign/" target="_blank">Applied Visual Design<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> is a review and practice of one of the most important concepts in CSS - the box model. I had to work on some changes and updates to a site that was given to me. Before the changes, the site used to be plain and simple. Click on the link for the final result.</div>    
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode5.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/mediaqueries/" target="_blank">Media Queries<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> project includes media queries to make a webpage responsible. The starter code contained a wireframed site that loaded on a mobile device in a readable manner. My task was to create a desktop and tablet version of this layout which displays when there is enough screen width to accommodate it.</div>
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode6.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/vacationsite/" target="_blank">Media Queries Vacation Site<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> improves the knowledge of media queries on a vacation site. I had to use the given webpage on the previous Media Queries project to make a responsive website. This time, I had to add images and other design enhancements.  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode7.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/flexbox/" target="_blank">Flexbox Design Patterns<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a>'s purpose is to work with Flexbox and understand how its items behave. I had to work on four different tasks to change and update the starter files. On the first task, I had to align the four items in a row. The second task was to update the code to make three items the same size. The third task was to center one element. The last task was to arrange the items into rows. </div>
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode8.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/landingpage/" target="_blank">Flexbox Product Landing Page<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> uses Flexbox for an effective layout on a landing page. This page uses Flexbox for layout that responds to desktop/laptop, tablet, and smartphone screen sizes. I had to use grid reordering with media queries in at least one view. This should be a full page, with a header, navbar, main content, at least one sidebar (aside), and footer. I also had to include at least one image that scales/flexes based on screen size. </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode9.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/homepagewireframe/" target="_blank">CSS Grid Layout<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> uses the Skeleton grid system to create a wireframe for the portfolio home page. Skeleton uses a 12-column fluid grid with a max-width of 960px, that shrinks with the browser/device at smaller sizes. My home page utilizes the Skeleton grid system.</div>
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode10.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/gridhomepage/" target="_blank">CSS Grid Portfolio Page<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> uses the same wireframe as Project 10 to complete the design of the home page. I had to include and explain the list of each project on this course utilizing the Skeleton grid system. I also had to add an image for each project. I chose to use QR code to link to their pages. </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode11.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/bootstraptraining/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Training<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> was a tutorial I had to go through in order to learn how Bootstrap works. After completing the entire section on bootstrap tutorial, the task was to capture a screenshot showing the checkmarks for all 31 lessons. Then create a page for my portfolio called Bootstrap Training and add my screenshot.</div>
    <div class="one-half column"><img class="qr" src="images/qrcode12.png" alt="QR code" style="width:70px; height:70px;">The <a href="https://grazigomes.github.io/resumepage/" target="_blank">SPA Bootstrap Resume Page<i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 12px; color: black; font-weight: bold;">&#xe895;</i></a> uses Bootstrap to create a resume page. This project is focused on design. This page needed to have at least four sections, including a styled table and a contact form. It also had to be responsive for extra small devices, tablets, small devices, desktops, and large devices. Lastly, the navigation needed to be optimized for mobile display.</div>
